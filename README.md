# Spider Man 3 Fix

simply go to releases download SpiderMan3Fix.zip put the d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini into your game folder next to the game exe and your good to go 

FOV mod is off by default (0) in the ini you have 3 options to choose from in this fix, slightly zoomed out, a bit more zoomed out and mega zoomed out (1),(2) or (3) 

you can edit settings in d3d9.ini 

fullscreen resolution is set to (0) by default this is off or 1920 x 1080 make sure your set to 1920 x 1080 in game for the d3d9.dll resolution fix to work and then you can choose whatever resolution you want from the d3d9.ini

aspect ratio is calculated by the resolution you set in the ini.   

Default for FPS cap is 60 you can change it to whatever number you like or uncap with 0 (set vsync to fast in your pc to avoid screen tearing above your monitors refresh rate)

There are various issues with higher FPS in game such as: 

   - Mad Bomber mission 3 - Kicking bombs into the ocean doesn't work because they explode in mid-air.
   - Dragon Tail mission 2 - Stopping the helicopter from dropping doesn't work because it drops too quickly to stop.
   - Dr. Connors mission 1 (after removing the black suit) - When all 3 serum ingredients are collected, the game may crash.
   - Daily Bugle photo mission 2 (Arsenic Candy beauty contest) - The 3rd girl will walk off the stage instead of stopping to pose and the show will never continue.
   - A random side mission involving the Dragon Tails and bombs inside a bank - The bombs will become too sensitive to movement to be taken outside for disposal.

To fix this a hot key which can be set before you play the game (a message box will apear and tell you what to do)
this has been added to this fix so that you can switch between the fps limit you give the fix in the ini and 30 fps the origional games fps when you get to any broken 
part in game you can then switch from the patched high fps to the origional game fps (30) to be able to play any broken parts of the game then after you get past them toggle back to your high fps with the hotkey key you chose.

This just toggles between (30fps) and (uncapped "whatever fps you define in D3D9.INI FPSLimit = " )
