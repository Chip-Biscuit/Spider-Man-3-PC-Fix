# Spider-Man 3 PC Fix

# Instructions
Go to release, download the Spider-Man 3 Fix that fits the requirements you need, then extract the d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini into your game install folder next to game.exe and your good to go! You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d9.ini file.

# Resolution/Aspect Ratio
This applies to all fix releases; you must have launched the game once and set the resolution to 1920x1080 in the video options menu. If this is not done, then the d3d9.dll file will not work correctly.
Resolution is set to (0) by default this is off or 1920 x 1080. Choose a resolution that is correct for you from the selection within the d3d9.ini file and replace (0) with the number correct for you.
If you boot up the game after setting the resolution you want in the d3d9.ini file and the resolution has not changed automatically then go to the video option menu in game and select your resolution from in there.
The aspect ratio is automatically calculated by the resolution that you have set in the d3d9 ini file.

# FOV
FOV is off by default in the ini which is set to (0). The d3d9.ini file has 3 options to choose from in all the fixes, slightly zoomed out, a bit more zoomed out and mega zoomed out (1), (2) or (3).
