# Spider-Man 3 PC Fix

# Instructions
Go to release, download the Spider-Man 3 Fix that fits the requirements you need, then extract the d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini into your game install folder next to game.exe and your good to go! You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d9.ini file.

# Resolution/Aspect Ratio
This applies to all fix releases; you must have launched the game once and set the resolution to 1920x1080 in the video options menu. If this is not done, then the d3d9.dll file will not work correctly.
Resolution is set to 1920x1080 by default in the d3d9.ini. Choose a resolution that is correct for you by entering your width and height within the d3d9.ini file.
If you boot up the game after setting the resolution you want in the d3d9.ini file and the resolution has not changed automatically then go to the video option menu in game and select your resolution from in there.
The aspect ratio is automatically calculated by the resolution that you have set in the d3d9 ini file.

# FOV
FOV is off by default in the ini which is set to (0). The d3d9.ini file has 3 options to choose from in all the fixes, slightly zoomed out, a bit more zoomed out and mega zoomed out (1), (2) or (3).

# FPS
Default for FPS cap is 60 you can change it to whatever number you like or uncap with 0.
This game uses an FPS toggle feature. This is required to be able to play the game properly and allow the player to complete certain parts of the game that break on any FPS higher than 30fps. There are 2 versions of the fix for FPS one which allows the user to use a button of their choice for the toggle feature. The other version sets the key ‘P’ to the toggle key by default. These are explained below.

# Spider-Man 3 Fix
The FPS can be toggled with any key the player chooses. There will be a message box that will pop up before the game launches which will give you instructions on what you must do. Click OK on the first pop up message box, then click any button on your keyboard or mouse and it will then confirm the button choice and launch the game. Then in the game you can use the key you have selected to toggle between 30 and the desired FPS (set in the d3d9.ini file) within the game at any time.

# Spider-Man 3 Fix-NoMessageBox
This version has no message box asking you to choose a key before launching the game. The FPS toggle key will always be ‘P’ on the keyboard.

# List of various bugs that can happen within the game at FPS higher than 30.
•    Mad Bomber mission 3 - Kicking bombs into the ocean doesn't work because they explode in mid-air.

•    Dragon Tail mission 2 - Stopping the helicopter from dropping doesn't work because it drops too quickly to stop.

•    Dr. Connors mission 1 (after removing the black suit) - When all 3 serum ingredients are collected, the game may crash.

•    Daily Bugle photo mission 2 (Arsenic Candy beauty contest) - The 3rd girl will walk off the stage instead of stopping to pose and the show will never continue.

•    A random side mission involving the Dragon Tails and bombs inside a bank - The bombs will become too sensitive to movement to be taken outside for disposal.
